            <p className="paragraphtext">Hi! I am a college graduate with a degree in Computer Graphics from Purdue University.  I have been front-end coding since early high school days.  My area of focus was in javascript and UI/UX development, though my degree had me learn anything and everything in computer graphics including 3D modeling, animation, and game design.</p>
            <p className="paragraphtext">I am an Eagle Scout, and have put a lot of my effort into achieving this rank. I lead multiple groups over the course getting to Eagle, and I think my leadership skills carried with me to lead group projects, be the lead at work when teaching at my University, and learning to be spread work out to those that are best suited to it. I am also a member of the National Society of Success, which focused a lot on how to lead groups and introduced me to some very interesting ideas regarding leadership.</p>
