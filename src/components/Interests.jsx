            <p className="paragraphtext">I am interested in fantasy.  Something about fantasy worlds and world building as a whole is something that I think about. It really peaks my interest when a fantasy world can have epic stories that all make sense somehow! I have thought about making a world of my own using basic plot points and general rules for the universe.  On top of that, I just enjoy relaxing like most people. I enjoy just being alive and having time to think about random things.</p>
            <p className="paragraphtext">I enjoy the outdoors as well. With my background from Scouting, I learned to enjoy being out in nature and just taking pride in enjoying the outdoors.  As such, I enjoy fishing, camping, and the challenges that come with being outdoors when possible.</p>
